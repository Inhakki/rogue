# Rogue

Rogue is a lightweight, un-opinionated library that provides helpful javascript classes to create super fast web-based, single-page apps.

This library is built using fast and native vanilla javascript with NO external dependencies. This means things will process a lot faster than other front-end libraries like jQuery and Dojo and contain a lot less bloat.
It also supports IE9+ and all modern browsers (including mobile).
