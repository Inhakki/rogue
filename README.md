# Rogue

Rogue is a lightweight, un-opinionated library that provides helpful javascript classes to create super fast web-based, single-page apps.

Besides the very few dependencies, this library is built using fast and native vanilla javascript. This means things will process a lot faster than libraries like [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [Dojo](http://dojotoolkit.org/) and contain a lot less bloat.
It also supports IE9+ and all modern browsers (including mobile).

## Included Libraries

* [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) - AMD and dependency management
* [ElementKit](https://github.com/mkay581/element-kit) - Fast DOM manipulation for Elements

## Usage

You can use any class provided by Rogue by simply [requiring](http://requirejs.org/) one of the [rogue.js files](https://github.com/mkay581/rogue/tree/master/build).
More detailed usage and specific examples can be found in the [Examples](https://github.com/mkay581/rogue/blob/master/examples).
