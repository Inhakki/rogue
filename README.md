# Rogue

Rogue is a lightweight, un-opinionated library that provides helpful javascript classes to create super fast web-based, single-page apps.

This library is built using native vanilla javascript. This means things will process a lot faster than other front-end libraries like jQuery and Dojo and contain a lot less bloat.
It also supports IE9+ and all modern browsers (including mobile).

## Dependencies

Only dependency is [ElementKit](https://github.com/mkay581/element-kit), used for fast, cross-browser DOM manipulation for HTML Elements.

## API Documentation
